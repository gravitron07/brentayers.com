          <h3 class="contentItem__head contentItem__head--large fadeInDown animated">I specialize in front end design/development, flawless code, and standards compliant websites and applications.</h3>
          <p class="fadeInDown animated">Iâ€™ve been creating websites and applications in the Atlanta Area for about 12 years now. I strive to make every site I make not only visually appealing, but useable and engaging for everyone that sees it. You can rest assured that the final product I deliver will be scalable so that as your business grows, your site can too.</p>
        
          <h4 class="contentItem__head fadeInUp animated">My Background</h4>
          <p class="fadeInUp animated">I'm a web designer/front-end developer residing in Atlanta, Georgia with my wife and three daughters. I have been building websites and front end applications for over a decade and I think I'm getting pretty good at it.

          <h4 class="contentItem__head fadeInUp animated">Where I've Been</h4>
          <p class="fadeInUp animated">I started designing websites professionally in 2000 at Fidelity National Information Solutions. While at Fidelity, I designed real estate websites for RE/MAX, Keller Williams, Realty Executives, and Century 21. After leaving Fidelity in 2004, I went the agency route and worked on some really cool projects for various clients around Atlanta. After a brief stint as a contractor I was offered an amazing opportunity to come work as a front-end developer on WebMD's strategic initiatives team, and ultimately settled in to lead the mobile web development team. I left WebMD in 2012 and I am now a front end lead at The Home Depot, where I get to enjoy the break neck pace of online retail selling LOTS of hammers and nails.</p>
